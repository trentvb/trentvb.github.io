            <p>I've got a big idea. I want to ride my bike 600 plus miles from my house in northwest Iowa to my in-laws in eastern Illinois. On the way I want to stop at my brother and sister-in-law's house near central Iowa. I want to do it in less than two weeks. I want to do it by myself camping along the way. I want to make big miles and go at my own pace. I want to have fun. Most of all, I just want to do it--deep down I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>I want to cook my own food as well. Not all of it--I look forward to greasy
burgers at small town diners with fries on the side. I want to make Ramen
noodles, beans and rice, and the occasional pork chop or steak on my small camp
burner I haul along with me on my bike. I want to make instant coffee in the
morning before I pack everything up and hit the road again.</p>
<p>I want to sleep in my tent in small campgrounds along the way. I want to pedal
up to the site with everything I need on my bike. I want to setup camp, get a
good night's rest, and pack up in the morning ready for whatever awaits.
Hopefully, it will be smooth pedaling and gorgeous weather. I want to be
prepared in case it is not.</p>
<p>I want to be flexible enough to adjust to reality. Right now the idea is to make
it to my stop in central Iowa in a fairly short amount of time. If that doesn't
happen because of weather or anything else, I'm willing to use support to get
there and reset the trip.</p>
<p>I want to write about the trip before, during, and possibly after. I want to
take pictures and possibly video. I think this will be difficult for me since
most of the time, taking pictures is usually an afterthought. Perhaps I'm too
old to be a part of the &quot;snapchat&quot; generation. I usually tend to want to enjoy
the moment as it is instead of interrupting it for a &quot;selfie.&quot; Call me
old-fashioned. I don't mind. But, a trip like this deserves to be documented and
I think, in the end, I'll be glad I did.</p>
<p>I call it an &quot;idea&quot; because that is it's current state. It hasn't quite made it
past the point of being called a plan. Hopefully, writing all this down will
help it cross that line. We'll see.</p>
