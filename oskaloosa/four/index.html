                by Trent Van Bemmel
            </p>
            <p>For all intents and purposes, day 3 should have been a wonderful day. The forecast
called for sunny skies. Most of my riding would be on the famed Raccoon
River trail. The goal for the day was 60 miles instead of 90 or more. It should
have been a cake walk. For me, it wasn't.</p>
<p>I was burned out. It took me way longer to pack up camp since my numb palms
sapped my finger dexterity. It was the first time I had my camping stuff out in
a while and I had to remember how it all went back together. I got off to a late
start.</p>
<p>Shortly after getting on the trail in Jefferson, I came up to a roadblock that
said the bridge was out. Apparently the ice build up was enough to take out a
section of the bridge during the spring thaw.</p>
<p>I made the five mile trek around the section– two thirds of the distance being
gravel--before rejoining the trail.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was uneventful except for the internal struggle I was
facing. I knew this trip was going to be tough. I was hoping that it was going
to be fun as well. That is the slice of &quot;crazy&quot; you latch onto as a cyclist--the
idea that taking the harder  way from point A to point B will reward you in some
other way--exercise, endorphins, a sense of accomplishment, just something.</p>
<p>I was on vacation and I was having a really hard time calling the trip &quot;fun.&quot;
The too long days on the bike were taking their toll physically. At the same
time, I was disappointed in the fact that I wasn't able to find a campground
closer to Oskaloosa, my first destination. That meant I was probably going to
have several hours of downtime by myself at the campground. Every option had its
downside.</p>
<p>I'm not extroverted by any stretch of the imagination. At the same time, I'm
used to being around my wife and five kids. Traveling, eating, and camping by
myself was getting kind of old and lonely.</p>
<p>I had one more day before I reached Oskloosa and I decided to wait until
arriving before making any decisions about the second half of the trip. That's
what I told myself anyway.</p>
